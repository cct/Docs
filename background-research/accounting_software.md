# Why a closed and commercial accounting software?

We decided to use DATEV as the accounting software for the non-profit company. There are some reasons to do so.

In Germany we have other accounting regulations than e.g. in the US  
* Accounting software needs to be certified by tax authorities at least once per year. DATEV is certified. 
* German tradelaw demands comparability. This is done by using a given account number range. Every item (e.g rent, salary, depreciation, bank accounts, paypal acc) gets a fixed number. At the end of the year there are complex rules to close these accounts off and create the year statement. These rules are in DATEV and it works 95% automated.
* The data coming out of DATEV can be easily used by any tax adviser if we need one.
* DATEV provides mechanisms accepted by German tax authorities to have all documents electronical. No need to keep paper longer than needed (normally you need to keep every piece of paper 6 to 10 years)
* DATEV is cappable of different VAT valid in Germany and does it automated.
* Imports are made with simple CSVs - like any other accounting tool
