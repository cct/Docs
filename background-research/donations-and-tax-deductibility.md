# Donation receipts

In order to get tax-deduction, many countries require specific
terms to be mentioned in donation receipts. As far as we know,
the USA does not require anything special other than mentioning
the non-profit status. I've seen donation receipts meant for
tax deductions that only carried an email address and no mention
of a name.

In general, it is not straightforward to claim tax deductions for
a donation towards a non-profit in a foreign country.

## European situation

The European Court of Justice ruled in January 2009 that tax-payers
should be able to claim tax deductions for donations given to
non-profits in other European countries. Unfortunately, this ruling
did not lead to automatic acceptance of cross-European donations. 
Your local tax office can claim that it does not know if the recipient 
is actually a registered tax-exempt non-profit, and it can argue
that it has no way of knowing whether that document in that foreign 
language actually properly confirms the legal status.

Some countries seem to be better at accepting claims, but it seems
it is at least required to send a letter in which you cite that 
ruling before your donations will be accepted as such. [Here's a Dutch example](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/centres/sci/newssummary/news_29-5-2015-9-11-34) of how it can work with just a letter.

Our own experience is limited. In other non-profits, so far, we 
have asked a couple of donors from other European countries to send our "official" German 
donation receipt, plus a signed English translation, plus German 
letter by the tax office confirming our tax status, to their own tax 
offices and ask if that was sufficient, but we have yet to hear of 
any results.

If you have some experience, please add it!

### Transnational Giving Europe

Because it is still difficult, a number of European non-profits
formed the ["Transnational Giving Network"](http://www.transnationalgiving.eu/) (currently in 18 countries). 
As a donor, you can donate to the local partner organization, get the 
proper local document and make the tax offices happy.

TGE takes a 5% cut, the rest will simply be transferred to the final 
beneficiary.

We might want to become a partner, until we have built our own 
"transnational giving network" together with other non-profits of the 
Free Software world.

Even just to find out how they do it, it's worth getting in touch. They
might have useful knowledge on how to write donation receipts for easier
acceptance in other EU countries.

### USA to Europe

[King Baudouin Foundation United States](http://www.transnationalgiving.eu/) offers a similar
service for European and African foundations that want to offer "straightforward" 
donations to their US donors. There's a one-time signup fee of $1500, 
and they also take a 5% cut (plus 3% credit card fees for credit card payments).

You will not be able to simply receive the money from KBFUS: You can "suggest"
how they spend the money, and there are some reporting requirements. 
In that sense, KBFUS is a fiscal sponsor.

## Germany

Below 200€ per year (per beneficiary), a donor can use their bank 
statements, plus a generic letter than confirms the legal status. This
generic letter can be put online for a simple download (basically
"Hereby we confirm that we are a registered non-profit, here's the reference
number of our latest tax status confirmation.").

Above 200€, or if the donor asks, in order for her to claim tax deductions, 
we need to send a donation receipt that contains the address of the donor, 
the amount of the donation, and a bit more boilerplate text. And, it has
to be signed by an authorized person. Some tax accountants say that they
never heard of any problems with electronically delivered receipts (that
then of course contained a scanned signature). Legally, this is possible
only after you have asked your tax office for permission 
(["machine-produced" donation receipts, maschinell ohne Unterschrift, §10b Abs 4 EStR](http://www.vereinsbesteuerung.info/leitfaden_spende.htm)) 
-- and even then only for money donation receipts, not for donation of goods.

We will try to get this permission immediately after we are registered, but
it is possible that they reject this until we have final charitable status.
(~1 year later)

### Electronic filing

The respective law was updated in 2009 to allow electronic filing of 
donations by the beneficiary (§50 Abs 1a EStDV). The beneficiary needs the 
tax ID of the donor to do this. It is not actually implemented yet. Since
it is not possible yet, we have not investigated this further, but collecting
tax IDs is scary too, maybe scarier than collecting donor addresses?
