# Postal Mail Services

Yeah, unfortunately  postal mail is still a thing. We and our projects
will receive some mail, and we need to send mail also.

So far we've mostly looked into receiving mail.

## Incoming Mail -> Scanning 

We want to offer projects (and team members?) the option to receive 
postal mail via CCT. In some sense that's a requirement since we will 
legally "run" the projects, so it makes sense to think about scalability 
of scanning dead tree mail.

### Manual

For smaller orgs, it makes sense to do it manually. From our research,
affordable dedicated duplex multipage-scanners are inferior to 
full-fledged office copiers with duplex-scanners. Used models of the 
latter are often quite easy to find for free or for cheap, but of course 
fill more space.

### Scanning Services

So far, we've only investigated for Germany, since our own
fiscal sponsor will be in Germany. Feel free to add info for
more countries.

## Outgoing Mail

At least in Germany, you're supposed to send donation
receipts manually signed, by postal mail. There seems to be a 
possibility to individually get your local tax office Finanzamt 
to allow you to send them electronically or at least without 
signature.

We will talk to them immediately after our formal registration.

In any case, it is useful to also investigate services
that turn emails/PDFs into actual mail.

### Germany

We haven't really looked into it yet.
