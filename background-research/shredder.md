# Document Shredding

We will handle various paperwork for various projects. So,
getting a shredder is a no-brainer.

## DIN-66399

[DIN-66399](www.shreddingmachines.co.uk/securitylevels.asp?id=1&cat=Din security levels) defines security levels for shredding (level 1-7).

We are currently reaching out to various shredder companies
to see if we can get a shredder of at least level 5 donated 
for RFF as a non-profit Human Rights foundation.

- We have an [HSM Securio B22 1.9x15](http://www.hsm.eu/en/products/shredding/document-shredder/hsm-securio/securio-b22/19x15-mm/) now (security level 5)! Thank you Juris, and thanks HSM!
