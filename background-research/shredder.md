# Document Shredding

We will handle various paperwork for various projects. So,
getting a shredder is a no-brainer. We're currently
reaching out to various shredder companies as a charitable
non-profit to see if we can get one donated.

## DIN-66399

[DIN-66399](www.shreddingmachines.co.uk/securitylevels.asp?id=1&cat=Din security levels) defines security levels for shredding (level 1-7).

We are currently reaching out to various shredder companies
to see if we can get a shredder of at least level 5 donated 
for RFF as a non-profit Human Rights foundation.
