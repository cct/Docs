# Comparison with other similar organisations

We are not alone in the world in providing a home for free and open projects. Herein is a list of some of the organisations that offer a similar service to ours. Not two organisations are alike.


## Umbrella organisations

The Center for the Cultivation of Technology is an umbrella organisation, which means that our aim is to host several projects, without discriminating between different technologies etc. In this section you can find organisations that are similarly open to different projects joining them.


### Apache Software Foundation

Us :)

We aim to be as lightweight by default as possible. At least initially we plan to concentrate on providing financial services, as such our services are:

- accounting and budgeting
- financial, tax and donor reporting
- setting up and managing of donations (including crowd-funding)
- grant management and reporting
- managing contracts, employment and merchandise


### \[The Commons Conservancy\]

- registered in: the Netherlands
- entity type: stichting – public benefit organisation
- <http://commonsconservancy.org/>

Does not handle money at all, only intangible assets, guaranteeing that the projects will forever remain free and open. Offers its service for free. Does not require transfer of copyright, but does maintain a [list of approved CLA/CAA][tcc_ldw] that projects may use to transfer the rights to it.

It also aims at being lightweight and modular. As such, the basic services it offers are:

- assurance that the intangible assets will forever remain free and open
- governance rules with sane defaults (and optional additions)
- status to receive charitable donations (to an account at a different organization)

There are several organisations out there that concentrate on serving a specific wider project or groups of projects around a specific technology.


### GNOME Foundation

### KDE e.V.

Historically it had limited itself to hosting only software that was based on Qt and was part of the KDE desktop environment.
