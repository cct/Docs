# Walk through 
This doc gives a short walk through for a small group in interaction with CCT.

## actors
* CCT
* prject (Project Cloudless) 
  Project Cloudless is a small group of developers working on free and open source tools to erase the need for commercial cloud products. It consists of three individuals. After they released their first beta, people are signaling that they want
    * donate Money
    * join the project
* Individual A (Alice)
* Individual B (Arthur)
* Individual C (Bob)
* Donor A
* Donor B

## Before anything happens

Anna, Arthur and Bob were doing some research wether they should build a company or a non profit around their project. They found out that the overhead for such an entity is nothing they want to do. After some searching around they found out that there is the CCT. They get in contact with the CCT to ask if they might join with their project.  
The CCT and the group have some prior talks and decide, that they will be in a good place during the beta phase of the CCT platform . They do a contract which allows the CCT to represent the group to the outside and collect donations for them. The contract is signed electronically. The message pops up at CCT that the contact is signed.

## Setting up at CCT

* All individuals create an account at the platform
* the project gets an internal number for the platform
* the project gets a number for DATEV
  * the internal number and the DATEV number can be the same, but there is no need for it.
* The CCT creates the project on the platform and the three accounts are added as admin accounts to the project. 

__Note: In a later interation of the platform this process will be automated as follows:__
* All individuals create an account at the plaform
* One of them creates a project. 
* the request is posted on a forum platform not decided yet will be posted and dsicussed by other projects in this field.
  * They decide to reject the project. This will be mailed by the platform to the group. END.
  * They decide to approve. 
* Contract is signed electronically 
* After it is approved by CCT the project will be created with the creating individual as administrator. Internal numbers will be set automatical. The DATEV number is entered manually by the CCT and is part of the approving process. 
* The remaining individuals join the project and get the appropiate user rights set by the project adminsitrator.

Moving on with setup:  
* A Widget URL for embedding donation form on websites will be created
* A subforum on a yet not specified platform will be created  (this maybe a discourse instace, we are not sure yet)
